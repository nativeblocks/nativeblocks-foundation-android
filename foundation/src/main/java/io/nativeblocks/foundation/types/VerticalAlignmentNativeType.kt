/**
 * A class that implements [INativeType] to handle conversion of [Alignment.Vertical] to and from strings.
 * This class is used to represent the [Alignment.Vertical] type in a string format, such as "top", "bottom", or "centerVertically".
 *
 * Example usage:
 * ```
 * NativeblocksManager.getInstance()
 *     .provideTypeConverter(Alignment.Vertical::class, VerticalAlignmentNativeType())
 * ```
 * In this example, the [VerticalAlignmentNativeType] is registered with the [NativeblocksManager] as a type converter
 * for the [Alignment.Vertical] class, enabling seamless conversion between [Alignment.Vertical] and its string representation.
